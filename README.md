# butter

A low-contrast color scheme for Terminal.app and Vim, designed by someone who
actually stares at code all day.

Inspiration: [I can't believe it's not butter](http://dotshare.it/dots/672/)
for color base, Irwin/x0r for the highlighted strings.

## Installation

1. Download Butter.terminal and run it

2. Copy butter.vim to ~/.vim/colors/butter.vim

3. Add the following lines to ~/.vimrc:

```
syntax on
set t_Co=16
colorscheme butter
```

4. For Python users, we want multiline strings to be highlighted as comments
   rather than strings, because the light background tint on strings looks
   ugly on docstrings. Copy python.vim to ~/.vim/syntax.
